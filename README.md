The movie industry is of intense interest to both economists and the public because of its high profits and entertainment nature. An interesting question is to forecast movie business, because investors in the movie market want to make wise decisions.

Social media such as Twitter and YouTube have been used for sharing contents and comments on all types of subjects by millions of people on a daily basis. It is clear that businesses have a strong interest in tapping into these huge data sources to extract information that might improve their decision making process. For example, predictive models derived from social media for successful movies may facilitate filmmakers making more profitable decisions.
